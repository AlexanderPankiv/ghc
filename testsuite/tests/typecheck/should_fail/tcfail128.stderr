    No instance for (Data.Array.Base.MArray b0 FlatVector IO)
      arising from a use of ‘thaw’
    The type variable ‘b0’ is ambiguous
    Potential instances:
      one instance involving out-of-scope types
      (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: v <- thaw tmp
    In the expression:
      do { let sL = ...
               dim = length sL
               ....;
           v <- thaw tmp;
           return () }
    In an equation for ‘main’:
        main
          = do { let sL = ...
                     ....;
                 v <- thaw tmp;
                 return () }
