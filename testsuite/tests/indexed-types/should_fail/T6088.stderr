    Couldn't match type ‘Pos n’ with ‘True’
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (C (B n))

T6088.hs:16:33:
    The full inferred context for deriving (C (B n)) is (Pos n ~ True)
    Try using this context for standalone-deriving.
